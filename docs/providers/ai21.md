# [AI21 Studio](https://www.ai21.com)

AI21 Studio is a platform developed by AI21 Labs that provides developers with access to powerful language models like jamba-instruct through APIs. These models enable various text generation and comprehension features for numerous applications. AI21 Studio emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to fine-tune models for specific tasks, and cost-effectiveness, with its unique tokenization that offers more text per token compared to other providers. Their comprehensive suite includes tools for summarization, paraphrasing, grammar correction, and more, making it a valuable resource for developers seeking to integrate advanced language capabilities into their projects.

## Interface Name

- `ai21`


## Model Aliases

The following model aliases are provided for this provider. 

- `default`: jamba-instruct
- `large`: jamba-instruct
- `small`: jamba-instruct
- `agent`: jamba-instruct

## Embeddings



## Options

The following values can be passed through `options`.

- `logprobs`: Includes the log probabilities of the most likely tokens, providing insights into the model's token selection process.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `n`: Specifies the number of responses to generate for each input message. Note that costs are based on the number of generated tokens across all choices. Keeping n as 1 minimizes costs.
- `stop`: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
- `stream`: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, similar to ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the output more focused and deterministic. Generally, it is recommended to alter this or top_p, but not both.
- `top_logprobs`: _Details not available, please refer to AI21 Studio documentation._
- `top_p`: Controls the cumulative probability of token selections for nucleus sampling. It limits the tokens to the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. It is recommended to alter this or temperature, but not both.


## Features

- Embeddings: true

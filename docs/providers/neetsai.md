# [Neets.ai](https://www.neets.ai)

Neets.ai offers a cloud-based platform for text-to-speech (TTS) and conversational AI solutions. Their Text-to-Speech API allows developers to convert text into natural-sounding speech using a variety of voices and languages. Additionally, their Conversational AI API provides tools for building chatbots and virtual assistants capable of engaging in real-time conversations. Neets.ai leverages deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to deliver high-quality and customizable solutions for businesses and developers seeking to integrate voice and conversational capabilities into their applications and services.

## Interface Name

- `neetsai`


## Model Aliases

The following model aliases are provided for this provider. 

- `default`: Neets-7B
- `large`: mistralai/Mixtral-8X7B-Instruct-v0.1
- `small`: Neets-7B


## Options

The following values can be passed through `options`.

- `frequency_penalty`: Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, reducing the likelihood of repeating the same line. Positive values reduce the frequency of tokens appearing in the generated text.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `n`: Specifies the number of responses to generate for each input message. Note that costs are based on the number of generated tokens across all choices. Keeping n as 1 minimizes costs.
- `presence_penalty`: Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, encouraging the model to talk about new topics. Positive values increase the likelihood of new tokens appearing in the generated text.
- `response_format`: Defines the format of the AI's response. Setting this to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, ensuring the message generated by the model is valid JSON.
- `seed`: A random seed for reproducibility. If specified, the system will attempt to sample deterministically, ensuring repeated requests with the same seed and parameters return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed.
- `stop`: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
- `stream`: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, similar to ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the output more focused and deterministic. Generally, it is recommended to alter this or top_p, but not both.
- `top_p`: Controls the cumulative probability of token selections for nucleus sampling. It limits the tokens to the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. It is recommended to alter this or temperature, but not both.


## Features

- Streaming: true
